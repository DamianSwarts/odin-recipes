        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This dip for 2 was inspired by my love of pizza but also wanting a dip.
            Ooey gooey cheese, savory pepperoni and a crisp panko crust really hits the spot on chilly afternoons! 
            Serve with toasted bread pieces or crackers.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
            <li>½ (8 ounce) tub cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>⅓ cup pizza sauce, purchased or homemade</li>
            <li>8 ounces pepperoni, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>¼ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
